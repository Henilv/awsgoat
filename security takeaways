This project explores AWSGoat, a deliberately vulnerable collection of AWS services that mirrors real product, service, and data hosting patterns. The environment is deployed, enumerated, and stressed to understand how misconfigurations, weak trust boundaries, and flawed IAM policies create exploitable conditions. 
Pacu, an open‑source AWS exploitation framework, is then used to simulate attacker behavior through credential abuse, privilege escalation, enumeration of service permissions, and lateral movement across poorly segmented resources. 
Each attack path is validated, mapped to underlying cloud components, and correlated with insecure defaults or architectural gaps. The workflow produces a structured set of findings that highlight IAM weaknesses, excessive roles, unrestricted storage access, overly permissive network controls, and monitoring blind spots. 
These observations are then transformed into layered defensive controls: baseline IAM hardening, network boundary reduction, service‑level guardrails, logging and alerting improvements, and secure‑by‑default infrastructure definitions. The result is a reproducible, cloud‑security reference demonstrating how vulnerable infrastructure is exploited and how secure configurations prevent recurrence.
