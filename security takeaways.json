  "awsgoat_project_summary": {
    "overview": "This project analyzes AWSGoat, a deliberately vulnerable AWS environment representing real product, service, and data-hosting patterns. The environment is deployed, enumerated, and stressed to understand how misconfigurations, weak trust boundaries, and flawed IAM policies create exploitable conditions.",
    "exploitation_workflow": "Pacu, an open-source AWS exploitation framework, is used to simulate adversarial behavior across the stack. Attack flows include credential abuse, privilege escalation, reconnaissance of service permissions, and lateral movement through improperly segmented resources. Each exploit chain is validated and mapped to the exact AWS components that enable it.",
    "security_outcomes": "Findings highlight IAM privilege issues, network exposure, open data paths, logging gaps, and insufficient runtime controls. These insights are converted into layered remediations: hardened IAM baselines, constrained network boundaries, secure service configurations, automated guardrails, and continuous monitoring integrations.",
    "framework_alignment": "The results align with security frameworks such as NIST 800-53, CIS AWS Benchmarks, and MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud, mapping each exploited vector to the relevant control family. Runtime security principles are also applied by evaluating how real-time detection, anomaly monitoring, and least-privilege execution can contain the same attack paths if occurring in a live production environment.",
    "runtime_security_context": "The project demonstrates how vulnerable cloud architectures transition into hardened, runtime-enforced environments by correlating exploitation paths with required runtime defenses—such as IAM session enforcement, CloudTrail-based anomaly detection, AWS Config drift controls, and container-level runtime policies where applicable. This creates a lifecycle view connecting misconfiguration discovery, exploit impact, and protective runtime mechanisms."
