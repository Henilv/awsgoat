awsgoat_project_summary:
  overview: >
    AWSGoat represents a deliberately vulnerable AWS environment mirroring real product,
    service, and data-hosting architectures. The environment is deployed, enumerated,
    and stressed to understand how misconfigurations, weak trust boundaries, and flawed
    IAM policies create exploitable conditions.

  exploitation_workflow: >
    Pacu, the AWS exploitation framework, is used to simulate adversarial behavior across
    the cloud stack. Attack flows include credential abuse, privilege escalation,
    reconnaissance of service permissions, and lateral movement through poorly segmented
    resources. Each exploit chain is validated and mapped to the AWS components enabling it.

  security_outcomes: >
    Analysis reveals privilege issues, exposed network paths, open data access, incomplete
    logging, and insufficient runtime controls. These discovered weaknesses are transformed
    into layered remediations including hardened IAM baselines, restrictive network
    boundaries, secure service defaults, automated guardrails, and continuous monitoring.

  framework_alignment: >
    Findings align with NIST 800-53, CIS AWS Benchmarks, and MITRE ATT&CK for Cloud.
    Each exploited vector is mapped to its corresponding control requirement, illustrating
    how governance, detection, and prevention frameworks address the same weaknesses.

  runtime_security_context: >
    The project correlates exploitation paths with runtime defenses such as IAM session
    enforcement, CloudTrail anomaly detection, AWS Config drift monitoring, and container-
    level runtime controls. This frames AWSGoat as a full lifecycle study—connecting
    misconfiguration discovery, exploit execution, and real-world runtime protection.
